In this project, I dedicated efforts to dissecting annual weather-related data from the year 2012. The objective is to gain a deeper understanding of the prevailing conditions, fostering a clear view for better decision-making. The project unfolds through various stages :

ðŸ”´ Data Collection :

In this phase, I systematically sourced information from various channels such as websites and spreadsheets. This diverse dataset was then precisely organized and merged into a singular CSV file, which will serve as the central dataset for my subsequent analysis.

ðŸ”´ Data Exploration :

During this phase, I aimed to acquire a comprehensive understanding of my dataset. This involved inspecting general information, identifying and categorizing various features, and exploring the diverse types associated with each feature. I also meticulously examined the distinct weather conditions encountered throughout the year, quantifying their occurrences. To ensure data integrity, I conducted thorough checks for null values or any instances of incorrect data.

ðŸ”´ Data Filtering :

In this stage, I tried to filter the data based on specific, required conditions. This process aimed to discern the consequences associated with particular conditions and analyze the resultant outcomes in a more focused manner.

ðŸ”´ Data Visualization :

At this point, my aim was to visually represent the evolution of specific features under particular conditions. This visualization aimed to provide a clear insight into how these features change and the subsequent impact on other variables. Through comparison, I intended to identify any correlations or relationships between their variations.
